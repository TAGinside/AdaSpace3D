# AdaSpace3D 🚀

**The definitive firmware upgrade for your DIY SpaceMouse.**

**AdaSpace3D** is a drop-in firmware replacement for any DIY SpaceMouse using an **RP2040** and **TLx493D** sensor.

It fixes the biggest issue with previous DIY firmwares: **It replaces glitchy mouse/keyboard emulation with Native 3DConnexion Driver Support.**

Your DIY build will now be recognized by Windows/macOS as a genuine **SpaceMouse Pro Wireless**. No more glitchy shortcuts, no more keybinding headaches—just buttery smooth 5DOF navigation in 3D software (Fusion360, OrcaSlicer, Blender, etc.).

## 💬 Support & Community

I am still learning the ropes here on GitHub, so **support is offered mainly on Discord**.

This is also the place where we hang out to talk, make suggestions, and dream about the new upcoming **v2 SpaceMouse**!

## ✨ Features

* **Native Driver Support:** Emulates the official 3DConnexion USB protocol. Works out-of-the-box with standard drivers.
* **Unified Firmware:** One file for everyone. The code **automatically detects** if your sensor is connected via **Stemma QT (Cable)** or **Soldered Headers**.
* **Reactive Lighting:**
    * **Dual Drive:** Supports both Addressable (NeoPixel) and Standard LEDs simultaneously.
    * **Smart Feedback:** LED glows dim when idle and brightens as you move the knob.
* **5DOF Navigation:** Smooth X, Y, Z translation + Pitch and Roll.
* **Bulletproof Flasher:** Includes a custom "One-Click" build script that handles libraries, compilers, and upload automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hardware Limitation:** Spin/Twist rotation is **not functional** due to the physics of the current sensor setup. For best results, configure your 3DConnexion driver to use either **Pan/Zoom** or **Rotation** mode—not both simultaneously. Use the programmable buttons to toggle between these modes on-the-fly.

## 🛠️ Hardware Support

This firmware is designed for the **Adafruit QT Py RP2040**, but will possibly work on other RP2040 boards with possible minor pin changes.
The current project mapping keeps the four original QT Py buttons and adds extra named functions through an **MCP23017** expander. The MCP23017 mapping currently defines **11 additional buttons**, bringing the configured total to **15 buttons** like 3D SpaceMouse PRO Wireless.

| Component | Pin (Default) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sensor** | **TLx493D** | Auto-detects on `Wire1` (Stemma) or `Wire` (Solder). |
| **QT Py local buttons** | A0, A1, A2, A3 | Mapped to HID Buttons 13, 14, 15, 16. |
| **MCP23017 buttons** | A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, B0, B1, B2 | Mapped to HID Buttons 1, 2, 27, 23, 26, 24, 25, 3, 5, 6, 9. |
| **NeoPixel** | GPIO 4 | Addressable RGB Strip (WS2812). |
| **Simple LED** | GPIO 3 | Standard 2-leg LED (PWM brightness). |

> **Note:** The firmware drives **GPIO 3 and GPIO 4 simultaneously**. You can connect your LED to either pin depending on your build, and change the behavior in `UserConfig.h`.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Windows)

We have included a "One-Click" tool so you don't need to install Arduino IDE or mess with libraries manually.

1.  **Download** this repository as a ZIP and extract it.
2.  Open `UserConfig.h` in any text editor to customize your settings (Sensitivity, LED Colors, etc.).
3.  **Plug in** your RP2040 device.
4.  **Enter Bootloader Mode:**
    * Hold down the **BOOT** button.
    * Press and release the **RESET** button.
    * Release the **BOOT** button.
    * *A new drive named `RPI-RP2` should appear on your computer.*
5.  Double-click **`FLASH.bat`**.

The script will automatically:
* Download the compiler (Arduino CLI).
* Install the RP2040 Core and Infineon Sensor libraries.
* Compile the firmware with the correct "SpaceMouse" USB ID.
* Detect the `RPI-RP2` drive and flash it instantly.

> [!TIP]
> For manual builds without the script (Linux/macOS/advanced users), see [ADVANCED-INSTRUCTIONS.md](ADVANCED-INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## ⚙️ Configuration (`UserConfig.h`)

You can tweak the feel of your SpaceMouse without touching the complex code.

```cpp
// --- SENSOR SETTINGS ---
// Increase if movement feels too slow. Default: 150.0
#define CONFIG_TRANS_SCALE     150.0  

// --- LED CONFIGURATION ---
// 0 = Static (Solid Color)
// 1 = Breathing (Pulse)
// 2 = Reactive (Dim resting color, Brightens on movement)
#define LED_MODE            2

// Choose your preferred color (RGB 0-255)
#define LED_COLOR_R         0
#define LED_COLOR_G         255
#define LED_COLOR_B         255
```
